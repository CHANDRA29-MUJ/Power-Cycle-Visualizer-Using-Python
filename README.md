# Power-Cycle-Visualizer-Using-Python

An interactive Python-based tool to **visualize thermodynamic cycles** such as the Carnot, Otto, and Diesel cycles â€” ideal for mechanical engineering students and educators. This project uses **Matplotlib and NumPy** to generate Pressure-Volume (P-V) and Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagrams based on user input.

Power Cycles included are 
- Carnot Cycle
- Otto Cycle
- Diesel Cycle
