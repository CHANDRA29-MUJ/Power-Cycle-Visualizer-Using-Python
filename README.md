# Power-Cycle-Visualizer-Using-Python

An interactive Python-based tool to **visualize thermodynamic cycles** such as the Carnot, Otto, and Diesel cycles â€” ideal for mechanical engineering students and educators. This project uses **Matplotlib and NumPy** to generate Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagrams based on user input.

Power Cycles included are 
- Carnot Cycle
- Otto Cycle
- Diesel Cycle



  # Four Files are shown.
- Carnot Cycle.ipynb shows an example of P-V diagram of a Carnot Cycle based on assumped inputs.
- Otto Cycle.ipynb shows an example of P-V diagram of a Otto Cycle based on assumped inputs.
- Diesel Cycle.ipynb shows an example of P-V diagram of a Diesel Cycle based on assumped inputs.
- Power Cycle Visualizer.ipynb lets the user input required values for any of the three cycles. The code decides which cycle to build by asking the user the name of the process where Heat Addition takes place.


  # Future Work
  - Add more cycles like Brayton, Rankine and Dual Cycles to expand understanding.
  - Add Temperature vs Entropy (T-S) plots as well.
